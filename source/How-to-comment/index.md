There are two ways in which you can leave your ideas. You can leave a comment or create a pull request.
- [Pull Request](https://github.com/MarcoUmpierrez/blog-hexo/pulls): if you think that you can improve in some way any of the texts I've written, for example fixing grammatical or orthographical mistakes, I would gladly welcome all of them! just one thing, if it's not a small fixing like an orthographical mistake, then please, provide some explanation about why should I change that. I'm not expecting a master class but some reasoning behind your fix.
- [Comment](https://github.com/MarcoUmpierrez/blog-hexo/issues): I didn't set up any comment service like disqus because I don't like them. Instead, if you want to leave a comment, just create an issue in the repository of the blog. Despite of forcing you to have a github account, I think it's a great way to handle it because if you really end up doing it, it's because you want to say something meaningful, worth of the effort.
