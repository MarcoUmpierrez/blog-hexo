So, as a way of improving my language skills, I will commit myself to write a short text in English and German every day for the next 100 days. These are the rules:

- Write 40 or more words per text
- It is possible to skip one day but this will not count as one of the 100 days
- The text must be written in English and German
- It is possible to change some words or expressions but the general meaning of the text must be the same

If you have a better understanding of German language and you are willing to help, I will gladly accept any correction or remark you could have.
